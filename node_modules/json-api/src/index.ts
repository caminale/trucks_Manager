/**
 * Peer dependencies may or may not be installed (npm@3 doesn't install them

 * each peer dependency when necessary, by deferring the requires behind a getter.
 *
 * The imports for the getter-protected values (i.e., MongooseAdapter, KoaStrategy,
 * etc.) just bring in type information; they're not part of the compiled output.
